<p>Hi. My name is Jasmine Turner, as clearly noted by the largest bit of text on this page. *so much for not being obvious :(*</p>
<p>Long story short, I am an artist (the singing type) slash aspiring programmer.</p>
<h3>Long story long...</h3>
	<p>I started programming in September of 2013. By way of codeacademy.com, I quickly began using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create my first webpage. It landed me an interview with what I believe is a pretty awesome coding boot camp, Launch Academy. *inserts the truth* Okay, so maybe it wasn't all that easy. I did get an interview with Launch Academy, and I did use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create my first webpage in two days. I just left out the part that the webpage's code was horrible. Remember the DRY rule? Yeah, I totally broke that law. And I didn't get into the boot camp either. *laugh out loud*</p>
	<p>Prior to programming I had been working odd jobs. I was everything from a janitor to a musical theatre instructor. What remained consistent was the music. I've been writing music for a very long time, and singing for even longer. Every part of me wishes I could find a video to embed on this page as proof that I actually have musical talent. *inserts rewind button* Back to the 9 to 5 world.</p>
	<p>Currently, I am a Prep Assistant with the Sensory Department in the Research Lab at Nestle Purina. *gives 10pts to anyone who can say that ten times fast* I've been with Nestle, via Aerotek, since February 2015.</p>
	<p>Alright. Enough small talk. Let's get into some legitimate professional skills and random talents that I ooze on the daily. *inserts humble sauce*</p>
